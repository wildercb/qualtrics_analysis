For example, since I value privacy, I avoid posting sensitive details like my home address or full birthdate on social media. Instead, I might use an alias or adjust my privacy settings to limit who can see my information.

Security is also important to me, so I always enable two-factor authentication and use different passwords for different accounts to protect myself from hacking.

At the same time, I value trust and transparency, so when I do share personal experiences, I make sure I’m doing it on platforms that feel safe, like private groups or encrypted messaging apps.

By keeping these values in mind, I can stay connected online while also protecting my personal information.",No,,,,Neutral,,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,,,,Somewhat Comfortable,Agree,Significant Influence,"My cultural background and personal values have shaped how much I trust social media platforms with my privacy.

For example, coming from a background where family and community privacy are highly valued, I’ve learned to be cautious about what I share online. I avoid posting personal family matters or real-time locations because I was raised to believe that some things should remain private and not be exposed to the public.

Additionally, my personal value of security makes me skeptical of social media platforms that have had data breaches or unclear privacy policies. For instance, when I heard about Facebook’s data privacy scandals, I became more careful about what I post and even adjusted my privacy settings to limit who can see my information.

I also value authenticity and control over my own narrative, so I’m wary of how social media algorithms collect and use my data. This has led me to limit the amount of personal information I provide on certain platforms and to use encrypted messaging apps for more private conversations.

Because of these influences, I trust social media only to a certain extent, and I always take extra steps to protect my privacy online.
